# Liver-Surgery-Survival-Analysis
Multiple Regression R Model and Analysis
This project analyzes survival times for patients undergoing a specific type of liver operation. 
It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and multiple linear regression modeling.

## Dataset

The dataset includes information on 54 patients with the following variables:
- Survival Time (in days)
- Blood Clotting Score
- Prognostic Index
- Enzyme Function Test Score
- Liver Function Test Score
- Age (in years)
- Gender (0 = female, 1 = male)

## Analysis Highlights

- Data transformation and normalization
- Correlation analysis
- Gender-based survival time comparison
- Multiple linear regression modeling
- Residual analysis and model diagnostics
- Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis for multicollinearity

## Requirements

This project requires R and the following R packages:
- tidyverse
- corrplot
- PerformanceAnalytics
- car
